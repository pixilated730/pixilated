Below are simple instructions and notes you can include in a README file to explain what the code does and how to deploy it on GitHub Pages or run it locally:

What This Code Does

	1.	Fetches Channel Data from EyePapcorn API:
The code retrieves a list of TV channels from the https://api.eyepapcorn.com/ endpoint. Each channel includes information such as its name, logo, group, and a streaming URL.

	2.	Displays Channels in a Web UI:

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling and creates a user interface that lists channels in both grid and list layouts. A search bar allows users to search through channel names, and a dropdown filter enables filtering by channel group.

	3.	HLS Video Streaming:

When a user selects a channel, the code uses HLS.js (if supported) to stream the channel’s video. If HLS.js isn’t supported, it attempts to play the stream natively.

	4.	Recommended Channels:

The interface provides “recommended channels” based on the currently selected channel’s group. It shows a mix of channels from the same group as well as others, giving users additional browsing options.

	5.	View Toggling:

Users can toggle between a grid view and a list view to see channels in their preferred layout.

How to Run Locally

	1.	Prerequisites:

You only need a modern web browser. No server-side code is required since this is a static HTML page fetching data from a public API.

	2.	Steps:

	•	Save the provided HTML file (e.g., index.html) and ensure you have an internet connection.

	•	Open index.html in your web browser.

	•	The page will automatically fetch and display the channels from the API.

	3.	Local HTTP Server (Optional):

For some browser security settings, you may prefer running a simple local HTTP server rather than opening the file directly.

For example, using Python 3:

python3 -m http.server 8080

Then open http://localhost:8080/index.html in your browser.

How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

	1.	Setup a GitHub Repository:

	•	Create a new repository on GitHub and commit your index.html file (and any additional assets) to the repository.

	2.	Enable GitHub Pages:

	•	Go to your repository’s Settings.

	•	Scroll down to the Pages section.

	•	Select the branch (e.g., main) and root folder where index.html resides.

	•	Click Save.

	3.	Accessing Your Site:

	•	After a few moments, GitHub Pages will provide a URL (e.g., https://username.github.io/repository-name/).

	•	Navigate to that URL in a web browser to see the live site fetching data from the EyePapcorn API.

Notes
	•	API Availability:

The application depends on the https://api.eyepapcorn.com/ endpoint being accessible and responding with proper JSON data. If this endpoint is down or blocked, the interface won’t function properly.

	•	Browser Compatibility:

The streaming uses HLS.js. Modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari should work. Internet Explorer is not supported.

	•	Styling & Layout:

Tailwind CSS handles layout and styling. You can modify classes in the HTML to customize the look and feel.

	•	Security and CORS:

The API should allow cross-origin requests. If there’s a CORS issue, ensure the API permits it or use a local proxy.

By following these instructions, you can easily run the code locally or deploy it to GitHub Pages for online access.

Configure GitHub Pages:

In your repository, click the "Settings" tab.
In the sidebar, click "Pages".
Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
Choose the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., main) and the root folder (/).
Click "Save".
After a few minutes, your site will be live at https://username.github.io.
